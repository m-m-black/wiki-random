**wiki-random** is a site that I built to learn the basic of React. It loads 10 random articles via Wikipedia's REST API, then displays them in individual cards with title, summary and a link to the full article. 

### TO DO

- [ ] Implement infinite scroll such that new articles load upon reaching the bottom of the page
- [ ] Improve loading time of articles
